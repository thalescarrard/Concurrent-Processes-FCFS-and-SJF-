This assignment involves creating a program that will read numbers from a separate .txt file and use these
numbers to create a given amount of concurrent processes. The program will take as arguments the name of
the .txt file to be read, and the algorithm that will be used to perform the calculations (“FCFS” or “SJF”). The
.txt file contains the amount of processes as well as the arrival and burst times for each one of them. The
program will then calculate the waiting time and turnaround time for each process and output the order of
execution of the processes, together with the average waiting time and average turnaround time.
